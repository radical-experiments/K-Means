This the journal for the experimentation of the K-Means implementation with 
RADICAL Pilot.

Each folder is an experimentation iteration and their name will be Iteration and
a number. All figure files will provide in their filename the machine used to run
the experiment and the version of RP used. More inforation about each iteration
will be inlcuded here.

Iteration 1:
    Strong Scaling: The strong scaling experiment created 256 CU to calculate
    the centers of 256 clusters in a set of 67108864 elements. This configuration
    was run on Stampede for 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 cores.

    Weak Scaling: Each CU always uses 262144 elements to calculate 256 centers
    for the clusters. The number of CUs is also equal to the number of cores used.
    Those are 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256.
